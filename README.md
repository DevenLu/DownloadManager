# DownloadManager
If you need to request and upload files using the network; See [OKHttpUtils](https://github.com/duzechao/OKHttpUtils)

Relative performance has improved with native support and one database, and many-to-many association table, <br/> support breakpoint download, load and download tasks set to the same task with multiple listeners, <br />

Eliminating the need to add only a listener to a broadcast address multiple pages at the same time listen to the same download thread troubles, <br/>
With the basic functions, temporarily can not think of what you need to add functionality, there is a demand put forward, I add the phrase, <br/>
